### Nothing special

```sh
Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
```

### Nothing special

```sh 

The notorious Captain Schneider has given you a very straight forward mission. Any data that comes through the system make sure that only non-special characters see the light of day.

Create a function that given a string, retains only the letters A-Z (upper and lowercase), 0-9 digits, and whitespace characters. Also, returns "Not a string!" if the entry type is not a string.

```

### List Filtering

```sh 

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

Example
filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]
```
